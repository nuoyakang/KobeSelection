# KobeSelection_classification

In this observation study, we are challenged to predict Kobeâ€™s shot, which shots will find the way to the net. The existing dataset, which includes 25,697 shots records with 27 exploratory variables, describes the location and circumstances of every field goal attempted by Kobe Bryant during his basketball career. We will use the current explanatory variables to predict the outcomes of 5,000 shot attempts.
