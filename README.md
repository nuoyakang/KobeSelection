# KobeSelection_classification

In this observation study, we are challenged to predict Kobeâ€™s shot, which shots will find the way to the net. The existing dataset, which includes 25,697 shots records with 27 exploratory variables, describes the location and circumstances of every field goal attempted by Kobe Bryant during his basketball career. We will use the current explanatory variables to predict the outcomes of 5,000 shot attempts.

In this project report, we will first list out data manipulation including missing values treatment, outlier recognition, multicollinearity identification and we will give explanations about decisions we made. Then we will arrive at a simple model to answer 5 specific research questions. At last, we will provide comparisons of three predictive models, Logistic Regression Model, LDA Model and Cluster/logistic Model, and the comparisons are in terms of AUC, AIC, Mis-Classification Rate, Sensitivity, Specificity and objective / loss function.
